# Tralfamadore Change Converter
Greetings, earthlings! This is an app built to return you change in the Tralfamadorian currency. Tralfamadore uses base 12 currency, so this will return you the change you are looking for if you need to visit. Please enter the currency in your native land, then hit the transmogrify button!

A small app built on a Python backend to take an input of a number amount, and send back the coin totals to the client. Also using a React frontend. 

## Install instructions
This app was built on Python 3.8

You may wish to edit the run scripts to point where you want if you don't want to use this venv of Python.

Install dependancies:
- npm install

Boot server:
- npm run server

Run client:
- npm run client

Since it's a React app frontend, it should automatically open a browser tab to localhost:3000. Server is running on localhost:5000.
